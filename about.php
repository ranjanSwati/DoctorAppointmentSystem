					<p class="text-justify">Doctors are often called “life saviors.” As medical professionals, they diagnose patients and prescribe the appropriate treatment for their ailments. Without medical intervention, many patients would suffer gravely. With the growing advancement in medical technology, the work of doctors has become more efficient and able to tackle illnesses that come their way. With a very demanding job, they work around the clock to treat patients to save lives. They put their life on the line and treat even the most life-threatening diseases.The field of medicine is vast, and doctors specialize in a particular area. Doctors with such specializations include oncologists, pediatricians, cardiologists, neurologists, general physicians, dermatologists, gynecologists, and psychiatrists. Doctors with specialties receive training in a specific field of medicine to deal with complex nature problems.

The Doctor first tries to stabilize you on the spot with the help of the available life-saving drugs. In case hospitalization is required, you’re taken to your preferred hospital or closest hospital depending on the situation. At the time you become our member, you have to fill-up an ICE form (In case of Emergency Form), which helps us during Medical Emergencies. During an Emergency our emergency care team contacts all the hospitals in the ICE form and other nearby hospitals to ensure that a Hospital bed is ready, should you need one.
