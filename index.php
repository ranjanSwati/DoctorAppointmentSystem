			<p class="text-justify">Blood is universally recognized as the most precious element that sustains life. It saves innumerable lives across the world in a variety of conditions. The need for blood is great - on any given day, approximately 39,000 units of Red Blood Cells are needed. More than 29 million units of blood components are transfused every year. Donate Blood Despite the increase in the number of donors, blood remains in short supply during emergencies, mainly attributed to the lack of information and accessibility.

				<p class="text-justify">When we fall sick or sustain an injury, we consult a doctor who diagnosis us and prescribes us with the correct course of treatment. This doctor has appropriate knowledge after rigorous training to ensure the restoration of quality of life. As medical professionals, doctors have different specializations such as pediatrics, neurology, cardiology, etc.The importance of doctors shows in the work that they do. A doctorâ€™s life is not as easy as they must deal with many patients with varying symptoms. Using their expertise, they try to save as many lives as possible. They must work around the clock to ensure that patients get treatment. However, the profession has faced criticism, mainly due to the monetary exploitation of many doctors today.</p>

			A doctor's visit, also known as a physician office visit or a consultation, or a ward round in an inpatient care context, is a meeting between a patient with a physician to get health advice or treatment plan for a symptom or condition, most often at a professional health facility such as a doctor's office, clinic or hospital. According to a survey in the United States, a physician typically sees between 50 and 100 patients per week, but it may vary with medical specialty, but differs only little by community size such as metropolitan versus rural areas.
